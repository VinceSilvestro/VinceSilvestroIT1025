# Executive Summary #
For Lab 1 of IT 1025 at Tri-C, I broke into the world of information systems. Simply put, I was reminded of the saying "knowledge is power." Chapter 1 of <ins>Information Systems for Business and Beyond</ins> takes this idea a step further. David Bourgeois underlines how we must collect, store, organize and distribute data throughout organizations in order to make tangible improvements in our lives.

I learned that modern phenomena like smartphones, Wi-Fi, and gloablization are the direct result of past innovations. When they were introduced only a few short decades ago, the mainframe, the client-server model, and the internet forever changed the world. Information systems continue to streamline the way we communicate and do business with each other. As super-connectivity becomes more of a consumer expectation, businesses will probably invest in these systems increasingly, and make history. I look forward to mastering concepts in IT 1025 and changing lives with tech. 

On the software side, I got my GitHub account up and running. I took a shot at formatting my first readme.md file, which is this one.

# Information System Components 
Information Systems are defined by their components: hardware, software, data, people, processes, and network communication. An information system that I use every day is my family's digital shopping list. The system is an Android/iOS spreadsheet (software) that helps us make sure we always have our favorite groceries at home. The hardware includes each family members' smartphone and the network communication is Wi-Fi/4G. As we run out of listed items, family members (people) fill the checkboxes (data) next to the appropriate items. This signifies that we need to buy more. Additionally, family members write a note if we are almost out of an item. This is the process of the collaborative list.

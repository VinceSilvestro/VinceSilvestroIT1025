# Lucidchart

I used Lucidchart, a tool to help people better visualize processes and make diagrams, to organize the operations of an imaginary computer program. This program would ask for a number and then print "Big" if the number is greater than 15 or "Small" if the number is less than 15. Using Lucidchart for this task was straightforward. 

The Shapes sidebar in the platform offers similar tools available in Microsoft Paint or Google Drawings, for example, and is all-around user-friendly. I have seen flowcharts before, but was interested to learn that there are certain conventions for starting a flowchart, making a decision within the process, and ending a flowchart. It turns out that there are specific shapes for each of these steps for easy identification and implementation. I was surprised to discover that Lucidchart also offers templates for venn diagrams, family trees, and even floor plans.

Generally speaking I think that flowcharts are a great way to go about solving problems rationally and can be used in day-to-day life, too. Every day has a beginning, each decision that we make has consequences that we must face throughout the day, and every day has an end. The mind map template appears to be useful in this light.

# Introduction to Networking

- # Data Transmission 

To understand the basics of networking, it is important to understand terms like packet, packet-switching, IP address, DNS, and protocol. A packet refers to the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the Internet. A single packet contains the sender’s address, the destination address, a sequence number (which helps in ordering the man packet requests), and a segment of the overall message being delivered. Packet-switching is technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on its destination address. It occurs when routers reorganize packets for the most effective user experience possible. IP addresses, found in packets, are unique identifying numbers found on every individual device connected to the internet. The Domain Name System/Server, or DNS, is essentially a directory of IP address common names. DNS comes into play when a user requests to access a website. A DNS server is then queried and at that point returns the IP address of the host requested, which allows for proper routing. A protocol denotes a set of rules to allow devices to communicate. They dictate how communications take place on a given network.

- # Network Hardware

A hub connects network devices together on an internal network with the use of ethernet cables. A hub merely copies all packets to each connected network device and is not capable of selectively transferring data from one specific device to another. Switches differ in that they can in fact pass along data from one machine to another (or a group of them) exclusively. This is accomplished by virtue of the switch’s ability to read the physical MAC addresses of connected devices. This makes switches generally preferable over hubs as they reduce excessive network traffic, thus saving bandwidth.  

As cloud computing continues to dominate, another piece of network hardware called the router is even more preferred over the switch; routers are used to connect one network to another network based on their IP address. Hubs and switches are used to create networks, and routers are used to connect networks. 

- # Network Topologies

A network topology is a layout of how a network communicates with different devices. Most commonly, the star topology is a network made up of computers and hardware such a hub or a switch. When the switch in a star topologies is compromised, this is known as a single point of failure. 

Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh are two wireless topologies. They are similar because they both involve modems drawing an internet connection into a building and also switches to further carrying signals to wireless routers and then wireless devices. Wired devices are present in Infrastructure but not present in Wireless Mesh topologies. Wireless mesh takes the signal from the wireless router connected to the switch and repeats it to other nearby WAPs in the network. In my opinion, Wireless Mesh topologies are better because they offer stronger backup options to users in the network.

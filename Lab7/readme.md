# Executive Summary

In Lab 7, I explore the impact of file and folder compression and identify object oriented concepts in programming. In addition I practice creating and diagramming one class in particular on Lucidchart using UML Class Diagram icons.

# File Compression

The purpose of file compression is to reduce storage requirements and to improve transfer speeds. Compression breaks down longer strings of data into shorter strings of data to be reassembled later.

Upon compressing my .svg file from Lab 4 by right clicking it and selecting “Send to>Compressed (zipped) folder,” its size went from 2.71 KB to 1.14 KB.  A JPG version of the file came out to be 20.6 KB while its compressed counterpart came out to be 16 KB. I believe that SVG files are usually larger however this one in particular uses fairly basic mathematical structures to represent the image, making it smaller than an actual JPG.

# Python OOP

In object oriented programming, the methods of a class are the special kinds of functions that are defined within the class. In the common “shark” class example from digitalocean.com, the methods are specifically “swimming” and “being awesome.” “Self” would be the focal parameter here.

The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data. The constructor method is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 

A class is like a blueprint or prototype that you can define to use to create objects. An object is an actual instance of a class. To "instantiate an object from a class” simply means to bring an object into existence based on the parameters of a class as defined by the programmer.

The purpose of adding “vinny = Shark(“Vinny”) under def main(): was to define Vinny’s existence as a “Shark.” After I added “vinny.be_awesome()” next, Python called the ‘(self.name + “ is being awesome.”)’ method and printed “Vinny is being awesome,” since the ‘awesome’ parameters were defined underneath “class Shark.”

# Object Oriented Concepts

Using the example of ordering a meal at a drive-through window, two “classes” would be food and drink. At Taco Bell, an “object” of food would be a Crunchwrap Supreme and an “object” of drink would be a Mountain Dew Baja Blast Freeze.

In the digitalocean.com OOC example, “shark” is the class because it functions as a set of characteristics that describe objects. In this case “Sammy” is an object, since it is an instance of a class. An inheritance takes place when a broader class is created overtop an existing class, so in theory a “specific type of shark” class would inherit the traits of sharks in general. Encapsulation would refer to swim(self) because the fact that sharks in fact swim is not information that is actually printed in the program. Finally, abstraction relates to the definition of a shark since it hides irrelevant details and simply refers to objects, such as Sammy.

# Conclusion

In this lab, I investigated file and folder compression, object-oriented concepts in programming, and diagramming a categorical class on Lucidchart. I feel as though I have only scratched the surface in terms of what is possible with class diagramming. From my research, these layouts are the bases of databases and have the potential to make a definite impact on organizations of all kinds.

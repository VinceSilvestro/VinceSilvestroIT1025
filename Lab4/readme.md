# Executive Summary

This lab addresses a variety of examples of code. Attached are a handful of screenshots from Command Prompt and IDLE, which are programs that interpret code. In the later part of this lab, different ways to format/code pictures are discussed.

# Python IDLE

Python is a powerful tool capable of writing functions and more intricate programs. In IDLE, the coding program, interactive shell processes one code at a time and is great for experimenting. The file editor, the other side of IDLE, deals with many lines at a time; it is where we would type in a complete program.

# Code Examples

In Python, a variable temporarily stores a single value in the form of letters. Variables are case sensitive. Besides underscores, special characters are not allowed, and cannot begin with a number. An example of a usable variable would be Lobster_thermidor64. Variables like spam, bacon and eggs are acceptable because they are purely letters, do not contain special characters, and do not begin with numbers. 

BakedBeans = 7 is one possible assignment statement. Here, we are telling Python to assign a value (in this case 7) to a variable (or BakedBeans in this scenario). 

Functions contain code that are capable of carrying out a variety of tasks. In code, a function is its name followed by parentheses. Sometimes there are values passed to the function inside the parentheses. These are often passed to the function through keyboard input. len(‘xyz’) would count the number of characters inside the single quotation marks in the parentheses. 

The three general data types are integers (called ints), floating-point numbers (or floats), and strings (nicknamed strs). Ints like 65 are positive or negative whole numbers without decimals. Floats like 65.0 are positive or negative whole numbers with decimals. Finally, strings like 'asdfghjkl;123' always require single quotations and are treated as text.

# Graphics

- ### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Graphic designers work with files called raster and vector images. Often stock photos, raster pictures are made up of thousands, sometimes millions, of pixels. The more we zoom in on these photos, the more pixelated or grainy they become. A generally higher quality version of these are vector graphics. They are usually produced in professional programs like PhotoShop and do not become more pixelated when we zoom in on them. This is because they are composed of paths, or start points and end points, and other foundational bits of geometric code. Raster images would be most appropriate for thumbnails as they are less likely to be zoomed in on. Vector images would suit the needs of a background of a website for example since they are larger and more intricate. Sites can be accessed from devices with small screens and also quite large screens. 

- ### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Two discrete rates of image compression are lossless and lossy compression. Each method has its own benefits and drawbacks, which is why some developers feel so strongly about use of one over the other. Lossless compression preserves all of the data from the original files, resulting in the best quality possible. However, the ensuing pictures can take up much more space and may be unnecessary, leading to longer load times on websites and poorly managed storage space. This is why lossy compression, which actively reduces the quality of photos specifically to yield smaller files, can be a better solution in certain situations.

- ### File Formats
JPG, GIF, and PNG files are all types of image files, but not all types are created equal. GIFs, while they can also be pictures, are the only file types (of the ones previously listed) that are also capable of displaying animations. Simple pictures or short videos work best with GIFs. PNGs are great for images with high contrast and transparent content. JPGs are most useful when used with large, detailed photos without high contrast. 

- ### File Properties
My attached vector is the logo for a fictional company called Stork. In my imagination Stork is a droneshare app that allows users to rent drones in the same way that Uber allows users to share rides. It is also similar to how Lime lets users pay for electric scooter rental via their app. Stork units are reminiscent of Domino’s pizza delivery drones from 2016. They are mid-sized fully autonomous drones with storage compartments, and function as a faster way to transport snail mail and packages to friends and family. If you lock your keys in the car and your spare is at home, do not worry—via the app, simply call a Stork to fly to your house and ask a roommate to put the key inside of the Stork. Relax… it will be on its way soon. Need to drop off donations at your local nonprofit but would rather not use the gas? Call a Stork! Want to send over the dip you made for the party but you cannot attend after all, call a Stork! 

The logo’s minimal design portrays a white stork with a long orange beak and black eyes over a dark blue oval background. There are three layers in total. 

The SVG file has a size of 2.71 KB. By default, these kinds of files open with Internet Explorer. A program that might be better suited to open these would be Adobe PhotoShop.

# Conclusion 

We can see that syntax, capitalization, and other coding conventions are very important to the output, or the end result of a program. This was especially true while using Python, as variables would take on completely different values with a single letter being uppercase, or even if a single number preceded the rest of the typed variable. Using the ideal file type for each sort of  picture can save time, money, and storage space, too. I hope that one day I will be fluent enough in Python to develop the Stork app I outline above. I am quickly realizing that I have a lot to learn but I am still interested in learning the many grammar rules that come with Python.

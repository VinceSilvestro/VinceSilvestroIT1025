# Software

Software is an integral component of information systems. Its two major branches, operating systems and applications are the basis of all computing. Operating systems like Ubuntu manage hardware resources of computers and provide user-interface components. They also make the use of applications possible by providing a platform for developers to write more applications. Applications like Spotify “sit” on top of operating systems and allow users to carry out specialized tasks. As we know, apps on mobile devices and personal computers help us with things like taking notes, messaging other people and listening to music, to name a few possibilities. Utility programs are specific kinds of applications that allow users to patch unwanted characteristics of operating systems. Norton AntiVirus, for example, identifies malware on personal computers. 

Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, software serves the purpose of bringing an entire organization together within one program. Systems like Oracle utilize central databases to unify and streamline operations like sales, finances, and customer service.

Virtualization is another kind of software. It offers the ability to emulate virtual computers with different operating systems within one computer, for example. Hypervisors efficiently allocate system hardware to these virtual machines. Virtualization is useful because it provides higher performance and faster maintenance at lower costs. Network virtualization is an especially functional service that allows applications to run on a virtual network as if they were running on a physical network.

# Virtualization

Virtualization addressed two main issues with physical servers and single-vendor IT stacks when it was released. During the 90s, companies found the need to partition their servers and run legacy applications on various operating systems. Virtualization solves the problems of having an excess of unused server space and reduces costs associated with purchase, setup, cooling and maintenance of more physical servers. 

Hypervisors, key pieces of software in virtualization, are like messengers that separate physical resources from virtual environments and provide communication channels to these environments. They take physical resources and divide them up for use in services such as virtual desktops, servers, and operating systems often on an as-needed basis.

Although enterprises can benefit from both virtualization and cloud computing, these things are distinct ideas. Virtualization promotes the independence of computing environments from  physical infrastructure with the use of hypervisor resource management software. On the other hand, cloud computing delivers shared computing resources, like email and databases, on demand to practically any modern-day smartphone or personal computer.

A network administrator could move from virtualization to cloud computing by first creating a cloud. An admin might gather virtual resources and organize them using management and automation software and creating a self-service portal for users.

# Python 

The "pseudo-code nature of Python” refers to the informal way of programming that does not require any strict knowledge of programming language syntax. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program. 

The difference between an interpreted and a compiled language lies in the result of the process of interpreting or compiling. An interpreter produces a result from a program, while a compiler produces a program written in assembly language, according to Indiana University.

# Conclusion 

No matter if it is in a career in computer programming, web application development, website design, network management, or a job as computer support specialist, I am excited by the prospect of working with technology. Especially after watching will.i.am in the code.org YouTube video, I am extremely motivated to learn more computer-related vocabulary as it is. One thought-provoking excerpt I found in this week’s textbook reads this: “Cloud computing has the ability to really impact how organizations manage technology. For example, why is an IT department needed to purchase, configure, and manage personal computers and software when all that is really needed is an Internet connection?” Once completely virtualized, will companies slowly reduce professional IT forces? In my opinion, they will always have their place in the workforce. That being said, prospective employees must reap the benefits of co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry associations and student organization memberships to make the most out of their expertise.

For Part 2 of the final project I plan to pursue Option 1, which is to become co-op ready. I have already completed the first step of the co-op readiness process which is to submit the Co-op Student Application of Interest form to the Career Center. I look forward to participating in the co-op orientation process, also through the Career Center. I have submitted my resume to my Faculty Advocate, Professor David Sebold, and I am interested in receiving further feedback on my resume through College Central Network. Following this I will consent to the Cooperative Education Agreement form. 

Applying my fine-tuned resume, I plan to earn a co-op position in networking, which will ideally prepare me for a career in cybersecurity down the road. I am open to micro-internships, research-based employment, and other opportunities that I find. I have registered for Key Bank’s Virtual IT Career Tour event and am researching CompTIA’s A+ certification, which Professor Sebold recommended to me. Within the next five years I hope to be working with companies such as Lincoln Electric, University Hospitals, and the Cleveland Clinic to keep organizations safe and secure.
